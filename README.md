The SQL Programing Language

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a 4th generation declarative programing language that was designed specifically for managing relational databases. Essentially, SQL is an industry standard for managing data. As an example, a simple google search resembles a query, that is, retrieving data from a database. In other words, when you search for a coffee shop in your area, google reach for this specific data by translating your keywords into SQL code in order to “fish” for relevant data. The language was designed in the 1970’s in IBM labs by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce in an effort to build an effective way for finding and managing data in a computer system. It is important to note that SQL has other popular versions that look very similar and perform, in essence, the same functions. Examples include MySQL and PL/SQL.
	An example for “Hello World” in SQL looks like this:

SELECT 'Hello World';

Being short and simple to understand is an indication to SQL’s popularity and reason for success. The command SELECT in this code have the purpose of collecting a specific data from the database. In this example I am selecting the expression ‘Hello World’ from my data base. As an example, if my data base has many greetings in the English language, I am selecting the specific greeting that say “Hello World”. This greeting can be in relation to other “Hello World” greetings in other programing languages for example. By selecting this expression I can locate other similar expressions.
